# Covid-19-Analysis

# Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring and understanding the impact of COVID-19 through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) techniques. Our goal is to uncover valuable insights, trends, and patterns within the pandemic data using data visualization and predictive modeling.

# Features
**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Dive into comprehensive data exploration to uncover key trends, patterns, and correlations in COVID-19 datasets.

**2. Machine Learning Models**: Employ predictive modeling techniques to forecast trends, predict future cases, and contribute to a deeper understanding of the pandemic's dynamics.

# Technologies Used
**Python**: Utilizing the power of Python for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.

**Google Colab**: Interactive notebooks for detailed exploration, analysis, and visualization.

# Summary
A speedy and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is made possible by effective SARS-CoV-2 screening, which can also lessen the burden on healthcare systems. There have been built prediction models that assess the likelihood of infection by combining several parameters. These are meant to help medical professionals all over the world treat patients, especially in light of the scarcity of healthcare resources. The current dataset has been downloaded from the ABC government website and contains around 2,78,848 individuals who have undergone the RT-PCR test. The data set contains 11 columns, including 8 features suspected to play an important role in the prediction of COVID-19 outcomes. The outcome variable is the covid result test, whether positive or negative. 

# The following list describes each of the dataset’s features used by the model: 


# A. Basic information: 

1. ID (Individual ID)

2. Sex (male/female). 

3. Age ≥60 above years (true/false) 

4. Test date (date when tested for COVID)


# B. Symptoms: 

5. Cough (true/false).

6. Fever (true/false). 

7. Sore throat (true/false). 

8. Shortness of breath (true/false). 

9. Headache (true/false). 


# C. Other information: 

10. Known contact with an individual confirmed to have COVID-19 (true/false).


# D. Covid report

11. Corona positive or negative
